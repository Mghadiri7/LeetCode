# LeetCode Solutions in Python (Jupyter Notebooks)

This repository contains my Python solutions for LeetCode problems, written in **Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb)** format.  
I mainly use it to keep track of the problems I've solved.

## Structure
- Each notebook corresponds to a problem, named as:  
  `problemID.problemName.ipynb`  
  (for example: `1.two_sum.ipynb`)

## Notes
- All solutions are in **Python**.
